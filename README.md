# Bait
Bait is a simple clickbait article web api and page.

## About
You know those articles you always somehow stumble upon with titles like 'Top 5 Reasons Why You Should Clip Your Toenails (#4 Will SHOCK You!)' and then it loads a webpage that is full of ads an and loads really slow and then in your mind you're like 'ugh i just want a reason to clip my toenails not view 9001 ads'?

Yeah, me too buddy.

Bait is an elegant web api and page that allows users to create their own clickbait articles.
